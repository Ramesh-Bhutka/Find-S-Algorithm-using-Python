# Find-S-Algorithm-using-Python
Find-S algorithm is a basic concept learning algorithm in machine learning. Find-S algorithm finds the most specific hypothesis that fits all the positive examples. We have to note here that the algorithm considers only those positive training example. Find-S algorithm starts with the most specific hypothesis and generalizes this hypothesis each time it fails to classify an observed positive training data. Hence, Find-S algorithm moves from the most specific hypothesis to the most general hypothesis.
